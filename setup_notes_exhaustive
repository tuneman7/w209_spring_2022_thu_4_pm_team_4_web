This is a class in Javascript and HTML as Much as it is about the visualization objects.

Flask is a application framework that renders using Python.

Steps to get the application to work locally:

[ ] -- Pull the application down from Github.

git clone https://github.com/tuneman7/w209_spring_2022_thu_4_pm_team_4_web

[ ] -- Open the applicatin in Visual Studio Code -- Or Pycharm community edition.
[ ] -- Open a terminal window.
[ ] -- Run setup_venv.sh to get the virutal environment set up.
[ ] -- Run the script . rd.sh to start flask.
[ ] -- Browse from the UI.

EXAMINATION OF THE CODE:

[ ] -- Data Libraries -- This is where much of our collaboration will occur.
[ ] -- Altair Library -- Dependent on Data Libraries.
    [ ] -- Once we have a visualization working on collab moving it over should not be too difficult.
[ ] -- Rendering Framework -- Much work to be done.

COMMENTARY:

[ ] -- There is a lot of work to do.

GENERAL PROCESS MOVING FORWARD:

[ ] -- Meet more frequently for shorter periods of time.

[ ] -- Iterative -- 1st or second passes will give way to final product.


NOTE ON MAP:

[ ] -- This can be done, but it is not that easy -- But likely equal work to doing it in tableau and them managing 
     HTML chunks.
