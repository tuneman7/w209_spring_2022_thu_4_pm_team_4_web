(1) The time series shows how much an economy growth depends on trades.
For most of the countries, their GDP growth trends are highly correlated with their international trade trends. 
Indonesia, India and Netherlands are the exceptions. Their trade values as proportion of GDP are less correlated with the GDP growth rates.
Australia and Iran trade trends lag a year or two behind their GDP growth rates.
