<b>NAFTA Nations Trade, Internal and External</b>
<br/>

Since its inception in 1994, total trade amongst the NAFTA countries has increased substantially. One of the natural outcomes of the NAFTA Trade agreement is that the majority of the total trade for Mexico, Canada, and the United States, both aggregate and individually, is within the trade group itself. Since 2014, total inter NAFTA trade has consistently been around 40% of total trade. The charts and tool below show trade with North America vs. other countries.
