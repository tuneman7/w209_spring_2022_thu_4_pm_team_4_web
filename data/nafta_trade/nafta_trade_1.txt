<b>NAFTA Overview</b>
<br/>
The North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted in 1994 to stimulate trade amongst Mexico, Canada, and the United States and establish a world leading trading partnership. The key components of NAFTA were elimination of tariffs to promote trade of goods and services, reduced friction on cross border investment, protection of intellectual property, and best practices for foreign trade relations. We are investigating the impact of NAFTA by exploring their trade patterns amongst each other and amongst the other top trade countries of the world.

Since its inception in 1994, total trade amongst the countries has increased substantially. The charts below show NAFTA countries' trade with the World versus Inter NAFTA, including Net Trade and Total Trade by continent.
