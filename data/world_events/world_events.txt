2018		US-China trade War	"The China-United States trade war is an ongoing trade conflict between the United States and China.  It was initiated in January 2018 by the Trump Administration, at the behest of U.S. business interests seeking more access to the Chinese market. The primary weapon used by both sides in the trade war has been sanctions which have negatively impacted both countries.  In the United States it has resulted in higher manufacturing costs, which have been passed on to consumers, and in China it has led to decreased industrial output.  Some countries, such as Brazil have benefitted by agricultual exports to China increasing as China sought alternate import sources.  Other countries, such as Vietnam have benefitted by manufacturing moving from China into their nations.
