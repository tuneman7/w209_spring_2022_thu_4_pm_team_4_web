<b>Just How Much Trade Does the US do with China:</b>
<br/>
Despite the fact that China is the US' largest trading partner, it has accounted for less than 15% of total U.S. Trade in the past 6 years.<br/>
This suggests that the trade war may be about "unfair practices" but it may simply be an attempt at containing Chinese economic expansion, or penetrating the Chinese consumer market, which is unlikely to succeed.
