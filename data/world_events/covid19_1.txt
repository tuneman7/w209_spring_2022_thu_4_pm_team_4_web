<b>COVID-19 impact on trade</b>
<br/>
In 2020, most of the countries fell to the third quadrant where both trade and GDP have negative growth. There were only 2 exceptions. 
China remained in the first quadrant and maintained positive GDP growth and international trade growth. 
Iran maintained positive GDP growth despite its exports have been hard hit by the twin crises of COVID-19 and the crash in oil prices.
The size of the circle indicates the inflation rate in 2020. Stagflation began in several countries such as India, Mexico and Russia.
